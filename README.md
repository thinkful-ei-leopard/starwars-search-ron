# Star Wars Search Project

Author: Ron Martin

## TODO
 * Get Star Wars like font
 * Change color of "a long time ago" to aquamarine
 * Set an interval that shows "A long time ago" for 2-3 seconds before showing the rest of the website
 * Finish implementing the loading icon
 * Allow searches for more than just people via a select element

## Requirements
To complete the exercise you need to:

* Write a React app which allows users to search the Star Wars API for a character name, and displays the matching characters
    * For example, a search for "Skywalker" should list "Luke Skywalker", "Anakin Skywalker" and "Shmi Skywalker"
*The app must be deployed using Zeit's Now

Bonus points are awarded for:

* Gracefully displaying a loading indicator, and handling error conditions
* Being able select whether you want to search for planets, spaceships, vehicles, characters, films or species
* A passing test suite
